      <h2>Adaptive Ball Launcher – Human-Centered Mechanical Design Project</h2>

      <article class="project-block">

        <p class="project-description">
          I designed and prototyped an electronically operated, adaptive ball launcher intended to enable independent play for children with motor impairments. The goal of this project was to create a solution that was not only functional, but accessible, affordable, durable, and easily replicable using off-the-shelf components.
          I began by applying the engineering design process, defining the problem through user and client analysis with input from caregivers and pediatric occupational therapists. From this, I translated qualitative user needs into quantitative design criteria, including activation force, launch distance, adaptability to different projectiles, durability, modularity, and cost constraints. I used pairwise comparison methods to prioritize these criteria and guide design trade-offs.
          I then designed the mechanical system in Onshape, developing a modular, spring-actuated mechanism that converts stored potential energy into a consistent launch motion. I integrated electronic control using Arduino, allowing for low-force activation suitable for users with limited motor control. Throughout development, I applied tolerancing principles, documented decisions through technical memos, and iteratively refined the design based on testing data.
          I conducted quantitative and qualitative testing to validate performance, achieving consistent launch accuracy and stable operation across multiple conditions. This project strengthened my skills in mechanical system design, prototyping, human-centered engineering, technical documentation, and iterative testing, while reinforcing the importance of designing technology that is both effective and inclusive.

                Our first attempt at a low-fidelity prototype to test the launching mechanism. We used basic materials like cardboard and rubber bands to create a simple trebuchet-style launcher. We quickly realized this wasn't particularly safe for children and pivoted direction.

                Our second attempt at a medium-fidelity prototype, incorporating more refined mechanical components and spring-actuated controls. It was a lot more reliable than our first prototype, but still had issues with consistency and safety. We gathered feedback from occupational therapists and made further design adjustments.

                The final ball launcher prototype, showcasing the completed design with all subsystems integrated. A linear drive system powered by an Arduino microcontroller allows for low-force activation, making it accessible for children with motor impairments. The modular design enables easy adjustments for different projectile types and user needs.
