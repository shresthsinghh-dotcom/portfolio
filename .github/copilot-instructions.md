# Copilot instructions for this repository

Purpose
- This repository is a minimal static portfolio site (root: `index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`). There is no build tooling, package manager, or test framework present.

Big picture
- Single-page static site served from the repository root. Edits to `index.html` change page structure; `script.js` contains client-side behavior; `styles.css` contains presentation rules.
- Expect direct edits to these three files; there are no service boundaries, back-end APIs, or CI pipelines to update in this codebase currently.

Key files (examples)
- `index.html` — page markup and entrypoint. Look here for DOM structure and class/id names used by scripts/styles.
- `script.js` — client-side JS. Keep scripts unobtrusive and run on DOMContentLoaded if manipulating the DOM.
- `styles.css` — global styles. Avoid introducing a complex toolchain; CSS is plain and linked from `index.html`.

Developer workflows (discovered)
- Local preview: serve the folder with a static server. Example (platform-agnostic):

  ```bash
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```

- There is no `npm`, `package.json`, or test runner in the repo. Do not add build steps without confirming with the maintainer.

Project-specific conventions (discoverable)
- Keep all site sources at the repository root (no `src/` folder currently).
- Favor minimal, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS; avoid introducing frameworks unless requested.
- Keep interactive code in `script.js` and styles in `styles.css` rather than inline mixing — the repository shows a separation of concerns.

When to ask the user
- If you need to introduce a build tool, package manager, or CI changes, ask before modifying repository structure.
- Ask before adding third-party dependencies or creating new folders (for example, `src/`, `public/`, or `dist/`).

Examples to follow when making edits
- When adding a new interactive feature, update `index.html` with semantic markup (section, header, main), add behavior in `script.js`, and style in `styles.css`.
- Keep changes small and self-contained — this repo is currently simple and reviewers expect minimal diffs.

Notes for AI agents
- Do not assume any tests, linters, or formatters exist. If you add them, include the necessary config and explain required review changes.
- Preserve existing file locations and naming unless the user approves a refactor.

If any part of the codebase is incomplete or you need more context (for example sample content for `index.html`), ask the maintainer before adding scaffolding.
